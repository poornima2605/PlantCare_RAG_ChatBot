# 1. Load your plant documents

    "Yellow leaves can mean overwatering.",
    "To treat powdery mildew, spray with neem oil.",
    "Best soil pH for roses is 6.0 to 6.5.",

# 2. Load an embedding model (small but good one)
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# 3. Create embeddings
embeddings = model.encode(documents)

# 4. Create FAISS index
dimension = embeddings.shape[1]  # length of embedding vector
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dimension)
index.add(embeddings)

# 5. Save FAISS index
faiss.write_index(index, "vector.index")

# 6. Save documents
