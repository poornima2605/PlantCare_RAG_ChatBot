# ðŸŒ¿ PlantCare RAG ChatBot

A lightweight, intelligent chatbot that answers user queries about plant care using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Built with **FastAPI**, **OpenAI**, and enhanced with **dynamic image search** to show relevant plant visuals alongside answers.

---

## Features

- Semantic search-based context retrieval (RAG)
- Natural language answer generation using OpenAI GPT
- Image search integration using Unsplash API
- Web-based interface with FastAPI + Jinja2 templates
- CI/CD with Docker & GitHub Actions
- Kubernetes deployment via AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)

---

## Image Search Support

The chatbot now enriches responses with **relevant plant images**, fetched dynamically using the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers).

> Example:  
> **Question**: _"How much water does a rose plant need?"_  
> **Answer**: _"Rose plants typically need deep watering twice a week..."_  
> **Image**: A real-time photo of a rose plant is shown below the answer.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI API
- **Context Retrieval**: Custom semantic retriever
- **Frontend**: HTML (Jinja2 templating)
- **Image API**: Unsplash
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions + Docker
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes (AWS EKS)

---

## System Architecture


**Components:**
- User sends a question via frontend or API.
- FastAPI handles the request and passes it to the retriever.
- Retriever uses Sentence-BERT to embed the query.
- VectorStore retrieves relevant documents.
- Retrieved context is passed to the LLM for answer generation.

## CI/CD & DevOps Workflow

### Dockerized App

- Docker image builds using `Dockerfile`
- Optimized for lightweight deployment

### GitHub Actions

Automated pipeline includes:

- Linting & tests
- Docker image build
- Push to DockerHub or ECR
- Kubernetes deployment

### Kubernetes on EKS

- YAML manifests for Deployments & Services
- Helm chart support (optional)
- Secrets, ConfigMaps & autoscaling in production

---

## Request Flow

1. User submits a plant care question.
2. Question is embedded using Sentence-BERT.
3. Vector search finds relevant context and image using unsplash API.
4. Context + question are passed to the language model.
5. Response is returned via the FastAPI endpoint.
6. Image search search result is displayed.

### API Usage Example

Endpoint: /query
Method: POST
Payload:

{
  "question": "How often should I water a snake plant?"
}

Response:

{
  "answer": "Snake plants prefer to dry out completely between waterings. Water once every 2-3 weeks."
}

## Tech Stack

1. **FastAPI**: Web framework for building APIs
2. **Uvicorn**: ASGI server FastAPI server
3. **Sentence-Transformers**: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for semantic embeddings
4. **HuggingFace Transformers**
5. **Docker**: Containerized deployment

## Customizing the Knowledge Base

1. Add your .txt to the app/documents/ directory.
2. Rebuild the vector store by running app/create_index.py "path_to_new_txt".
3. Restart the app to load new embeddings.
