# 🌿 PlantCare RAG ChatBot

The **PlantCare RAG ChatBot** is an AI-powered assistant built using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that provides helpful information and personalized advice on plant care. Whether you're a seasoned gardener or a houseplant newbie, this chatbot leverages natural language processing to answer your questions based on custom plant care documents and models.

## 🚀 Features

- 🌱 **Plant care Q&A**: Ask questions about watering, light, soil, and more.
- 🔎 **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines vector search with LLMs to provide accurate and grounded answers.
- 🧠 **Sentence-BERT embeddings**: For high-quality semantic search using the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model.
- 📁 **Custom document support**: Easily extend knowledge base with your own plant care files.
- ⚡ **FastAPI + Uvicorn backend**: Lightweight and production-ready API.

## 🧩 System Architecture

![System Architecture](https://airbyte.com/data-engineering-resources/rag-architecure-with-generative-ai)

**Components:**
- User sends a question via frontend or API.
- FastAPI handles the request and passes it to the retriever.
- Retriever uses Sentence-BERT to embed the query.
- VectorStore retrieves relevant documents.
- Retrieved context is passed to the LLM for answer generation.

## 🔄 Request Flow

![Request Flow](https://medium.com/credera-engineering/build-a-simple-rag-chatbot-with-langchain-b96b233e1b2a)
1. User submits a plant care question.
2. Question is embedded using Sentence-BERT.
3. Vector search finds relevant context.
4. Context + question are passed to the language model.
5. Response is returned via the FastAPI endpoint.
